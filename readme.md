These projects were created during my learning of Full Stack Python with the Coding Dojo.

### Notes:
This repository contains project files as well as personal note files. Not all projects here have the appropriate `requirements.txt` generated, nor an exported database in some circumstances. I am working to clean up each folder as I continue to organize these projects. However, if there's a specific project you might have a question about, or if you might need a specific file not uploaded, please leave me a comment and I will do my best to accommodate!
