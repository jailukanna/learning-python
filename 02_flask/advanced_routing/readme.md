#Advanced Routing Assignment:

##Overview:
In this assignment, we will be learning how to work with route parameters in a Flask application (no Django). We will also learn in this assignment how we can access the route parameters from the view on our server side. This is simple but kind of cool.

##Notes:
+ See the code examples in this project and the inline comments for how this is achieved.
