			MySQL contains functions as well, and we can use these to manipulate our data


			CONCAT()
				// lets you put two values together

				SELECT CONCAT('Mr.' . ' ' . first_name . ' ' . last_name) AS full_name FROM clients;
				// this will add 'Mr.' to the front of all first names and join it with the last name in 'clients'
				// this data will be stored under the column 'full_name' (if you don't do this, your column will be the name of the code!)


			CONCAT_WS()
				// adds items with a space automatically (which the regular concat function does not)

				SELECT CONCAT_WS(' '. first_name . last_name . 'cool') AS full_name FROM clients;
				// this will add 'cool' to the end of the first and last names in 'clients'

			LENGTH()
				SELECT LENGTH(last_name) AS last_len FROM clients;
				// will give # of characters for last name in 'clients'

			LOWER()
				SELECT LOWER(first_name) AS first_lowercase FROM clients;
				// lower case all vals

			UPPER()
				SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS first_uppercase FROM clients;
				// upper case all vals


			HOUR()
				// actually part of DATETIME

				SELECT HOUR(joined_datetime) AS date_hour . joined_datetime FROM clients;
				// gives hour in 24 hour format


			DAYNAME()
				SELECT DAYNAME(joined_datetime) AS date_name . joined_datetime FROM clients;
				// gives name of day

			MONTH()
				SELECT MONTH(joined_datetime) AS month_number . joined_datetime FROM clients;

			NOW()
				SELECT NOW() AS right_now:

			DATE_FORMAT()
				// use w3schools or other resources to look up SQL DATE_FORMAT function parameters!
				%W - weekday name
				%M - month name
				%e - day of week name
				%Y - year

				SELECT DATE_FORMAT(joined_datetime . '%W %M %e %Y') FROM clients;
				// will give us data in format of 'Wednesday February 9, 2011'
