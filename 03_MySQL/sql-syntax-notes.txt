########


			UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = 'some_value', column_name2='another_value' WHERE condition(s)

			ex)

			WHERE id = 1;

			more advanced)
			UPDATE 'twitter'.'users' SET 'first_name' = 'KOBE' WHERE 'id' = '1'   

			**IMPORTANT WARNING**: if WHERE condition is not added to the UPDATE statement, the changes will be applied to *EVERY* record in the table!






########
#
#	DELETE
#
########


			You can DELETE your records as well. 

			If you are getting an error regarding SQL SAFE UPDATES, run the following command to let MySQL Workbench know that you know what you are doing and you want to DELETE stuff from the database.

			SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
			// lets SQL know you're safe and can delete now

			Deleting Records
			The SQL command pattern for deleting/removing records is as follows:

			DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition(s)
			**IMPORTANT WARNING**: if WHERE condition is not added to the DELETE statement, it will delete *ALL* the records on the table.

			another example)

			DELETE FROM 'twitter'.'tweets' WHERE 'id'='13';

			another example )

			DELETE from tweets
			WHERE id = 14;
