# Python Fundamentals
The files in this folder go over how to setup Python, some basics about the Python language, and how to setup Virtual Environments (important when working on Python projects). The `05_Assignments` folder covers a variety of Python challenges, which tap into basic Python usages, along with potentially using virtual environments. No frameworkrs are utilized here, and instead a familiarity with the language and how Python projects are managed is prioritized.
