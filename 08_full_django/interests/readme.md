# Optional Assignment: Interests
Create an app according to the wireframe below.
*see ./wireframe.png in this folder*

You will need to create a many-to-many relationship between User and Interest. What would happen when we input a user or interest that already exists in the database, versus if they did not?

Break the wireframe down into required routes:

##GET
1. '/'

2. '/users'

3. '/show'

##POST
4. '/add'


## Ninja Challenge:
Add the option to remove an interest from a user's list. Remember that this action should remove the connection, not the user or the interest. You'll need one more route, now!
