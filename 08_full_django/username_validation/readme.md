# Assignment: Username Validation
Create a new project that will validate a username.

## Validate the user as follows:

+ length of username should greater than 8 characters

+ length of username should be fewer than 16 characters

+ If the username is not valid display a notification "Username is not valid" on the root page.

+ Once a valid username is entered, save the username to the database.

+ On the success page display all the usernames entered, along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM) that each username was created.

### Ninja:
Allow the user to delete a username on the success page

### Hacker:
Make sure that the username is not a duplicate before inserting it into the database.
