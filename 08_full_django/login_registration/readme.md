# Assignment: Login and Registration
Rebuild the Login and Registration assignment from the flask chapter, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.


Build the following:
+ Show validation error messages if validations fail the following tests
+ First Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only
+ Last Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only
+ Email - Required; Valid Format
+ Password - Required; No fewer than 8 characters in length; matches Password Confirmation

Don't worry about hashing passwords for now. We'll take a closer look at hashing tomorrow.

+ Bonus: Birthday Field - Before today, or go creative and do it in an age range
+ Bonus: Implement Flash Messages

### One thing we've noticed as people build their login and registrations that you should consider:

`User.objects.get(email = email)`
- If there is not a matching email for a `.get()`, Django throws an error (try and except could come in handy).
- Otherwise it returns the User object associated with the matching user. e.g. `Userobject`.

`User.objects.filter(email = email)`
- `.filter()`, on the other hand, returns a list, so if there is no user that matches, it returns an empty list.  
- If there is a single matching user the list will contain a single User object: e.g. `[Userobject]`.



## Project Notes:
    - This would be a great template to build for your PYTHON belt exam.
    - Investigate the differences between your style of creating errors, and the flash-messaging built into Django.
    - It's possible you worked harder than you had to, ie, the flash messaging is probably easier than you think.
    - This project does not include hashing. Build that into your TEMPLATE for this LOGIN/REGISTRATION
    - Refactor wherever possible.
    - Setup Session so it can be easily imported also.
    - **Experiment with the built in password validators -- see settings.py password validation section**

## Development Issues:
    - Note: One thing that's important to understand is that when you use `User.objects.get()` in Django models, if no item is found,
    you get a `DoesNotExist` error. Unfortunately, you can't simply use this in your exception, ie `try: .... except DoesNotExist:`.
    The `DoesNotExist` will not be recognized. Instead, you must place your Model name in front, ie, `except User.DoesNotExist:` will be recognized!
