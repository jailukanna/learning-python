request.session['key']
This will retrieve (get) the value stored in key

request.session['key'] = 'value'
Set the value that will be stored by key

del request.session['key']
Deletes a session key if it exists, throws a keyError if it doesn’t. Use along with 'try' and 'except' since it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission

'key' in request.session
Returns a boolean of whether a key is in session or not

{{ request.session.name }}
Use dot notation (.) to access request.session keys from templates since square brackets ([]) aren’t allowed there


Only store small things in session -- it is inefficient
