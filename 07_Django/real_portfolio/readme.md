# Real Portfolio

Make a portfolio page with links between routes.

This might look like a lot but focus on what you have to do.

+ Make 4 templates
+ Create links to 3 different routes. Links will look like they did with Flask.
+ Have a url pattern for each route.
+ Render a different template from each route.

* See wireframe inside this folder for more information about this project. *
