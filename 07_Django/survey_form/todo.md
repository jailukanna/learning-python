Mark time when completed:
	(net time per this note: 18 minutes 2 seconds) -- goal <55 min

	TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 52 minutes (oof)
		
	What tripped me up:

		+ when using request.POST of a input[type=text], be sure to include a 'name' attribute in your <input type='text' name='my_name'>, this 'my_name' is used in your request.POST as follows: request.POST['my_name']  -- note this is NOT generated by the 'id' attribute for a text field -- other fields seemed to behave OK using 'id'

		+ learned you can't pass variables along in redirect same way you can in render. the way to pass variables along so other routes can access them is by using session or via a query string (imho less secure as the data is parsed into a url)
			see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18206630/how-can-i-redirect-to-another-url-and-pass-a-list-object-using-flask

		+ had to lookup a few form fields to remember proper use of attributes

		// mostly these were the time consuming things that probably added an extra 45min+...
