Your assignment is to implement the 5 methods above using delegating callbacks. You will have to modify the 5 methods to take in an array and a callback. Use what you learned in the previous chapter about callbacks to complete the assignment.

One important concept that we want you to learn through this assignment is  how to pass data to and from callbacks. You pass data to a callback with a parameter and you pass data from the callback back to the parent function with a return. While you are going through this assignment pay close attention to this relationship.

To understand what each method does, please refer to the underscore library.  Note that your method does not have to be as robust as underscore's; you just need to get the base functionality working. Therefore for most methods you will only have the list and a lambda as parameters, and for the lambda you will pass in each element and potentially a "memo" also known as a "collector".
