#
#################


	+ Linked Lists are another data structure (like an array or a dictionary), but allow us more "indexing" control over our data. That is to say, we can more easily insert and delete data, and in a more organized fashion than the certain limitations that can come with things like arrays, etc.


	+ Linked lists are made up of NODES

		+ NODES can store attributes, but TWO REQUIRED are:
			+ VALUE attribute - like  a string or number
			+ NEXT attribute - a POINTER which points to the next NODE


	+ Has a HEAD and a TAIL
		+ HEAD points to the first node in the List
		+ TAIL points to the last node in the List

		How do we determine second value in our list?

			`print head.next` will give us value next to `head` (note an object is returned)

		How do we get the head object?

			`print head`

		What if we want only the value inside the node instead of the object?

			`print head.next.value`

		What if we wanted value after that?

			`print head.next.next.next.value`
