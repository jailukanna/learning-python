#	Traditional Development vs. Test Driven Development (TDD)
#
#######

'''
	Traditional development follows the cycle: 
		Design -> Build -> Test , start over again
	The problem with this method is you might break something as you build each feature


	Test Driven Development instead, uses the following cycle:
		Write Test -> Write Code -> Improve Design , start over again
	TDD requires you to test throughout the entire development process

		The benefits:
			Clearer picture of how features work BEFORE building
			Develop without the fear of breaking an app
			Encourage improvement and refactoring code base to create leaner code

		The downsides:
			Larger time investment
			Additional complexity of code
			More code to maintain
