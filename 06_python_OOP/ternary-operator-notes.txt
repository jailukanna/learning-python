	Python has a ternary operator, which basically is a one line if-else statement.
	Python's ternary operator differs from other languages in its format:

		------Other Languages Like This------
		<condition> ? <result_if_true> : <result_if_false>
		----end other languages like this----

	Python's format is as follows:

		<result_if_true> if <condition> else <result_if_false>


Here's an example:

	print('Legal age' if age >= 18 else 'You are so young!')
