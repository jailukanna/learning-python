# Store

Now, let's build a store to contain our products by making a store class and
putting out products into an array.

Build a Store class:

+ Add the following Attributes:

- products: an array of products objects
- location: store address
- owner: store owner's name

+ Add the following Methods:

- add_product: add a product to the store's product list
- remove_product: should remove a product according to the product name
- inventory: print relevant information about each product in the store

You should be able to test your classes by instantiating new objects of each
class and using the outlined methods to demonstrate that they work.
