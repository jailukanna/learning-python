Run this file in terminal to see how it parses out the docstrings in your
`callcenter` module and converts it to a readable format.

Note: `docutils` is a program which supposedly can help convert these to HTML
automatically, but at present this was confusing and I couldn't figure it out.

You may want to join their mailing list on their website and ask for a
clean explanation on extracting docstrings to html.
